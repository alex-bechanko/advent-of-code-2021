Advent of Code 2021 solutions written in Rust

# Build
This Rust project uses [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) for building and running.
Once you have that installed, the project can be run with.

```console
$ cargo run
```

To pass flags to the program you can add a `--` and then add the parameters.
For example, you can run the program with `--help` by running this.

```console
$ cargo run -- --help
```
